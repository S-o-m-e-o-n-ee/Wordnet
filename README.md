The goal of this project was to create find the shortest common ancestor of a digraph in a WordNet. The three
programs in the project used to fulfill that goal are WordNet.java, ShortestCommonAncestor.java, and Outcast.java.
Wordnet.Java creates a data type to store a WordNet object. As well as creating the object and allowing access to the
components, this data type allows you to check if a noun is in the WordNet, find the shortest common ancestor between
two nouns, and find the distance between two nouns in the wordnet. ShortestCommonAncestor.java creates a data type
to allow for the computation of the shortest possible common ancestor for two nouns or sets of nouns in a wordNet as
well as the calculation of the distance between two nouns or sets of nouns. Outcast.java locates the noun that is
least related to the others in the same wordNet. These programs allow for many processes on WordNet objects.
